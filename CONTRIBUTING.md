# How to contribute

We would love to implement your contributions to this project! We simply ask that you observe the following guidelines.  

## Code Style

This project follows the guidelines in the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).


## Creating Issue
In order to effectively communicate any bugs or request new features, please select the appropriate form. If none of the options suit your needs, you can click on "Open a blank issue" located at the bottom.

## Testing
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/MLDSAI/OpenAdapt/actions/new) are automatically run on each pull request to ensure consistent behaviour and style. The Actions are composed of PyTest, [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/index.html).

You can run these tests on your own computer by downloading the depencencies in requirements.txt and then running pytest in the root directory.
