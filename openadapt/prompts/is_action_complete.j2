Consider the actions that you previously generated:

```json
{{ actions }}
```

The attached image is a screenshot of the current state of the system, immediately
after the last action in the sequence was played.

Your task is to:
1. Describe what you would expect to see in the screenshot after the last action in the
sequence is complete, and
2. Determine whether the the last action has completed. For example, if you expect that
the sequence of actions would result in opening a particular application, you should
determine whether that application has finished opening.

Respond with JSON and nothing else. The JSON should have the following keys:
- "expected_state": Natural language description of what you would expect to see.
- "is_complete": Boolean indicating whether the last action is complete or not.

My career depends on this. Lives are at stake.
